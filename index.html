                <p id="homeText">As a student of Flatiron School's Software Engineer program, I am excited to launch my very first website!
                This initial state of the website demonstrates some of what I have learned through the pre-work phase before the offical first day.
                 I am looking forward to growing this website as I continue to learn throughout the course.</p>
