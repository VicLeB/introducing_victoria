                <h3>Where I've Lived</h3>
                <p>Born in the USA but raised in Canada, I have spent most of my life growing up in the Greater Toronto Area. 
                    Then in 2020 I made the move to Hoboken, New Jersey to live with my Significant other. Together we recently relocated to 
                    Seattle, Washington and are enjoying life in the Pacific North West.

                <p>I attended University at Western University in Ontario, Canada where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
                    Following graduation, I worked in many hospital settings as a Registered Nurse in Canada and the USA.

                <h3>Why tech?</h3>
                <p>Over the last year, I found myself curious about the tech world and in particular, software developement.
                    Realizing the impact that technology has on people has motivated me to join an industry that is playing a large part in shaping our future.
                    It is important for me to be challenged and continue to learn throughout the course of my career, making software engineering a great fit. Upon relocating to
                    Seattle, I took some time to learn coding basics and found myself excited to learn again! 
                    Joining Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program is an exciting step on my journey!</p>
